# PaperScraper
Python Scraper code that downloads the wallpapers on https://wallpapercave.com/5120x1440-wallpapers for my monitor. Images are not mine or created by me nor is any of it my artwork. Made the code to specifically utilize the download button and automate the process rather than doing it for each image by hand.
